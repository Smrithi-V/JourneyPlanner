# Delhi-Metro-Journey-PlannerðŸš‡
## About
* This Android Application plans your Delhi Metro Journey by calculating the **Shortest Route** to make your journey **Time Efficient** and easy :)

* Application has a minimal user interface for ease of use.

* Contains **Adjacency List** of the entire DMRC network including Aqua Line and all interchange stations.
## How The App Works

* The App uses an algorithm called **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for finding out the shortest path between any two connected nodes of the weighted graph.

* The time interval between stations and the interchange time is taken to be the weight of edges.
## Dijkstra's Algorithm
* [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#:~:text=Dijkstra's%20algorithm%20(%2F%CB%88da%C9%AA,Dijkstra's%20algorithm)) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

* For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.

* It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.
